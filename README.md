# Privacy Policy

Revised 11/15/2023

## About the App
Signups (the "app") was developed by Michael Epstein (the "developer") and is offered free of charge and without warranty.

## What Information Does the App Collect and Store?

The developer respects your privacy and the security of your data. The app collects only the information that is required to enable your use of the app. 

The app securely stores Salesforce session and refresh tokens in your device's iOS keychain, but does not store your Salesforce username or password. Storing the tokens enables you to use the app without having to log in again with each use. For more information on these tokens and the user authentication process, see [OAuth 2.0 User-Agent Flow for Desktop or Mobile App Integration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_user_agent_flow.htm&type=5). When login is required, the app displays a web form which prompts you for your Salesforce username and password. The web form is hosted by Salesforce and the app never handles your Salesforce password.

The app collects PII about users for whom you want to provision a new Salesforce environment ("org"), but that information is not stored on the device and is transmitted only to Salesforce, over a secure Internet connection to Salesforce's [Signup Request API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/trialforce_enable_signuprequest_api.htm) endpoint.

The app downloads PII about users for whom orgs were provisioned in the past, using a secure connection to Salesforce's Signup Request API endpoint. The PII is only held in memory on your device, but is not persisted; the PII is deleted when you quit the app.

The app stores on your device any notes or labels that you create and associate with a particular signup request, Trialforce template or connected app.

## What Information is Accessible to the Developer?

The developer cannot access any of the information that the app downloads or stores on your device, and the app does not transmit any data to the developer. The app communicates only with Salesforce, over a secure Internet connection to endpoints that are managed by Salesforce.

## How Can I Delete Stored Information?

If you want to delete all the data stored by the app on your device, uninstall the app. If your device is lost or stolen, any tokens that may have been stored on the device could be revoked in Salesforce. See [Revoke OAuth Tokens](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_revoke_token.htm&type=5).

## Contact Information
